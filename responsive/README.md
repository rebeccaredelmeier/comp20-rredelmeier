COMP 20 Lab: Responsive Design
By Rebecca Redelmeier
Date: Feb 14, 2017

IMPLEMENTATION
I have correctly implemented a design that displays specific different parts of
an image depending on the width of the display area. The image is divided 
horizontally three times and vertically twice. A different 6th of the image
is dsiplayed at 6 different display widths. The display widths are incremented
200px, beginning at 0-200 and ending with 1200+.

COLLABORATION
I discussed this work with Meredith Clark and Tati Doyle

HOURS
This lab took me approximately 2 hours to complete
