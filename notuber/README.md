COMP 20 Lab: Responsive Design
By Rebecca Redelmeier
Date: March 9, 2017

IMPLEMENTATION
I have correctly implemented the NotUber webpage that retrieves my current location, sends this location and my username to the COMP 20 data store, and
retrieves and displays either the vehicles or passengers depending on what
reponse data that the data store sends. When the user's location (a sun flower)
is clicked on, my username will appear in an infowindow. When a passenger (baby) or
vehicle (car) is clicked on, its username and distance away from me (in miles) 
will be displayed in an info window

COLLABORATION
I received help from TAs in Halligan during office hours. (They're so helpful!)

SOURCES
I used the provided google maps API example (http://tuftsdev.github.com/WebProgramming/examples/google_maps/geolocation_map.html)
as a starting point. 

Also used the Google Maps API website (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) 
as a reference for placing markers, 
formatting the map, and general knowledge about the API.

Used stackoverflow.com as a general reference -- specific references can be found
directly in code 

HOURS
This assignment took me approximately 6 hours to complete
